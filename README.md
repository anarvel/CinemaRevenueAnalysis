Movie Revenue Analysis

STAT 3301 Final Project

Overview

This project analyzes factors associated with movie revenue, with a focus on whether higher production budgets are justified by higher expected returns. Using data on approximately 100 films, linear regression models are used to examine the relationships between revenue, budget, viewer ratings, and genre.

Methods

Exploratory data analysis and log transformations

Genre indicator construction

Model selection using adjusted 
R^2, AIC, and F-tests

Regression diagnostics and prediction with uncertainty

Results

Higher budgets and viewer ratings are associated with higher revenue, though budget exhibits diminishing returns. Action films tend to earn more than non-action films, holding other factors constant.
